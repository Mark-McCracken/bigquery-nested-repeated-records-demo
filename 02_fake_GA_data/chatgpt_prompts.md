<quote>Note that the output generated by the script will contain some random values and won't correspond to any real-world data. Also, keep in mind that the output will have 10,000 rows by default, but you can adjust the number by changing the value in the LIMIT clause.

<quote>change the sport generation so that sport can be one of
formula 1, football, tennis
change the league generation so that if the sport is formula 1, the league is one of formula 1, formula 2, formula 3, formula E, formula W,
if the sport is football, the league is champions league, europa league or premier league,
if the sport is tennis, the league is World Cup, or Wimbledon or Australian Open</quote>

<quote>This query generates sample data with custom dimensions for each hit that include the following dimensions: sport, league, match, matchState, and screen. The sport can be one of football, tennis, or Formula 1. The league is generated based on the selected sport, as follows:

- If the sport is Formula 1, the league can be Formula 1, Formula 2, Formula 3, Formula E, or Formula W.
- If the sport is football, the league can be Champions League, Europa League, or Premier League.
- If the sport is tennis, the league can be World Cup, Wimbledon, or Australian Open.

The rest of the data generation logic is similar to the previous query.

## Comments

Not bad at all!
It seems to have a pretty good grip on what the GA format should look like.
I got rid of some chunks, as the GA schema is huge and not all relevant to my example.

There were some small issues, like time intervals having floats rather than required integers, but overall, did a great job of getting some sample data.

Sometimes it went over the response limit, but these queries are very long, but a simple prompt to "continue generating previous output" got it to keep going.
